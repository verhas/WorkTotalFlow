Workflow Engine

 The <<<WofklowEngine>>> is primary misterious thing in CVW. Unless you want to
implement the CVW API you need not care too much about it.

 When you want to create primary workflow you have to create an engine that the
workflow will belong to and ... that is it.

 The workflow engine can be primary singleton or you can create one for each new
workflow definition. It does not matter functionally. The API does not
require more than that it exists.

 The simple implementation however uses this engine to maintain the loaded
instances of action functions. The action functions (conditions, prefunctions,
validators and postfunctions) are singletons in this implementation. This means
that whenever primary condition is instantiated for primary specific Java class it will be
reused by the engine.

 If for some reason you have to be sure that two different actions defined
by the same java class are different objects then they should not share
engine.
